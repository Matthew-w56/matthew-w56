### Practice Tracker - Mobile App to Improve Habits  <img src="https://github.com/Matthew-w56/matthew-w56/assets/26423158/9f94b4d4-8d70-4fd4-8474-a62bc3837908" width="26px" style="margin-top: 20px" />

As a side project, I am creating a mobile application for Android called Practice Tracker.  It's role is to help track the users' progress in a chosen habit, such as practicing an instrument or exercising.  It does this by utilizing a streak-keeping system, like the one Duolingo uses to help motivate their users.  The project is currently in it's early Alpha testing stage.  Google Play Store publishment pending.  Email me for an APK.
