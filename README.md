TapNote is a utility for musicians that are composing or arranging music.  It allows them to tap along to a rhythm, and see the musical notation generated for them!  Built from scratch with Angular, DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda, TapNote supplies users who log in with free cloud storage for their recordings, and has a number of options to fine tune the generated notes to what you want.

### Practice Tracker - Mobile App to Improve Habits  <img src="https://github.com/Matthew-w56/matthew-w56/assets/26423158/9f94b4d4-8d70-4fd4-8474-a62bc3837908" width="26px" style="margin-top: 20px" />

As a side project, I am creating a mobile application for Android called Practice Tracker.  It's role is to help track the users' progress in a chosen habit, such as practicing an instrument or exercising.  It does this by utilizing a streak-keeping system, like the one Duolingo uses to help motivate their users.  The project is currently in it's early Alpha testing stage.  Google Play Store publishment pending.  Email me for an APK.
